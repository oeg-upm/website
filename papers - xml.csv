conference_item,morph-GraphQL: GraphQL Servers Generation from R2RML Mappings,none,pub,public,paper,"GraphQL, R2RML, OBDA",Ontology Engineering Group  OEG,"REST has become in the last decade the most common manner to provide web services, yet it was not originally designed to handle typical modern applications (e.g., mobile apps). GraphQL was released publicly in 2015 and since then has gained momentum as an alternative approach to REST. However, generating and maintaining GraphQL resolvers is not easy. First, a domain expert has to analyse a dataset, design the corresponding GraphQL schema and map the dataset to the schema. Then, a software engineer (e.g., GraphQL developer) implements the corresponding GraphQL resolvers in a specific programming language. In this paper we present an approach that generates GraphQL resolvers from declarative mappings specification in the W3C Recommendation R2RML, hence, can be used both by a domain expert as without the need to involve software developers to implement the resolvers, and by software developers as the initial version of the resolvers to be implemented. Our approach is implemented in morph-GraphQL.",published,2019-07,The 31st International Conference on Software Engineering & Knowledge Engineering,"Lisbon, Portugal",10-12 July 2019.,conference,10.18293/SEKE2019-055,ETSI_Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,The 31st International Conference on Software Engineering & Knowledge Engineering,http://ksiresearch.org/seke/seke19paper/seke19paper_55.pdf,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/57184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
article,Using Machine Learning to Optimize Parallelism in Big Data Applications,none,pub,public,,"Machine learning,Spark,Parallelism,Big data",Ontology Engineering Group  OEG,"In-memory cluster computing platforms have gained momentum in the last years, due to their ability to analyse big amounts of data in parallel. These platforms are complex and difficult-to-manage environments. In addition, there is a lack of tools to better understand and optimize such platforms that consequently form backbone of big data infrastructure and technologies. This directly leads to underutilization of available resources and application failures in such environment. One of the key aspects that can address this problem is optimization of the task parallelism of application in such environments. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based method that recommends optimal parameters for task parallelization in big data workloads. By monitoring and gathering metrics at system and application level, we are able to find statistical correlations that allow us to characterize and predict the effect of different parallelism settings on performance. These predictions are used to recommend an optimal configuration to users before launching their workloads in the cluster, avoiding possible  failures, performance degradation and wastage of resources. We evaluate our method with a benchmark of 15 Spark applications on the  Grid5000 testbed. We observe up to a 51\% gain on performance when using the recommended parallelism settings. The model is also interpretable and can give insights to the user into how different metrics and parameters affect the performance.",published,2018-09-01,,,,,10.1016/j.future.2017.07.003,ETSI_Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17314668,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/51675,Elsevier,Future Generation Computer Systems,86,1076-1092,0167-739X,,,,,,,,,,,,

Semantic web",Ontology Engineering Group  OEG,"SPARQL endpoints provide access to rich sources of data (e.g. knowledge graphs), which can be used to classify other less structured datasets (e.g. CSV files or HTML tables on the Web). We propose an approach to suggest types for the numerical columns of a collection of input files available as CSVs. Our approach is based on the application of the fuzzy c-means clustering technique to numerical data in the input files, using existing SPARQL endpoints to generate training datasets. Our approach has three major advantages: it works directly with live knowledge graphs, it does not require knowledge-graph profiling beforehand, and it avoids tedious and costly manual training to match values with types. We evaluate our approach against manually annotated datasets. The results show that the proposed approach classifies most of the types correctly for our test sets.",published,2018,21st International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management,"Nancy, France",12-16 Nov 2018,conference,10.1007/978-3-030-03667-6_2,ETSI_Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03667-6_2,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/56289,Springer International Publishing,,11313,19-33,,56252,978-3-030-03667-6,,,,,,,,,,
conference_item,Efficient Clustering from Distributions over Topics,by-sa,pub,public,paper,topic models; semantic similarity; large-scale text analysis; scholarly data,Ontology Engineering Group  OEG,"There are many scenarios where we may want to find pairs of textually similar documents in a large corpus (e.g. a researcher doing literature review, or an R&D project manager analyzing project proposals). To programmatically discover those connections can help experts to achieve those goals, but brute-force pairwise comparisons are not computationally adequate when the size of the document corpus is too large. Some algorithms in the literature divide the search space into regions containing potentially similar documents, which are later processed separately from the rest in order to reduce the number of pairs compared. However, this kind of unsupervised methods still incur in high temporal costs. In this paper, we present an approach that relies on the results of a topic modeling algorithm over the documents in a collection, as a means to identify smaller subsets of documents where the similarity function can then be computed. This approach has proved to obtain promising results when identifying similar documents in the domain of scientific publications. We have compared our approach against state of the art clustering techniques and with different configurations for the topic modeling algorithm. Results suggest that our approach outperforms (> 0.5) the other analyzed techniques in terms of efficiency.",published,2017-12,Knowledge Capture Conference (K-CAP 2017),"Austin, Texas, United States",04-06 Dec 2017,conference,10.1145/3148011.3148019,ETSI_Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,Proceedings of the Knowledge Capture Conference on - K-CAP 2017,https://doi.org/10.1145/3148011.3148019,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/52009,,,,1-8,,,,"[1] Carlos Badenes-Olmedo, Jose Luis Redondo-Garcia, and Oscar Corcho. 2017.

conference_item,An initial Analysis of Topic-based Similarity among Scientific Documents based on their Rhetorical Discourse Parts,by-sa,pub,public,paper,,Ontology Engineering Group  OEG,"Summaries and abstracts of research papers have been tra- ditionally used for many purposes by scientists, research practitioners, editors, programme committee members or reviewers (e.g. to identify relevant papers to read or publish, cite them, explore new fields and disciplines). As a result, many paper repositories only store or expose abstracts, what may limit the capacity of finding the right paper for a specific research purpose.
Given the size limitations and the concise nature of abstracts, they usu- ally omit explicit references to some contributions and impacts of the paper. Therefore for certain information retrieval tasks they cannot be considered as the most appropriate excerpt of the paper to base these operations on. In this paper we have studied other kinds of summaries, built upon textual fragments falling under certain categories of the sci- entific discourse, such as outcome, background, approach, etc, in order to decide which one is more appropriate in order to substitute the origi- nal text. In particular, two novel measures are proposed: (1) internal- representativeness, which evaluates how well a summary describes what the full-text is about and (2) external-representativeness, which evaluates the potential of a summary to discover related texts.
Results suggest that summaries explaining the method of a scientific article express a more accurate description of the full-content than oth- ers. In addition, more relevant related articles are also discovered from summaries describing the method, together with those containing the background knowledge or the outcomes of the research paper.",published,2017,SemSci 2017 workshop co-located with ISWC,"Vienna, Austria",21-25 Oct 2017,conference,,ETSI_Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/52012,,,,,,,,"1.

Todos estos organismos públicos apoyaron el proyecto de Open Data que consistía en poner a disposición de ciudadanos y empresas toda la información que se pudiese, con el objetivo de facilitar su uso y fomentar la transparencia.
Los datos publicados están en formato RDF, y se pueden consultar utilizando SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol And RDF QueryLanguage).
Los datos de contratos públicos deben ser publicados siguiendo el estándar establecido por la ontología PPROC, de manera que la misma aplicación pueda utilizarse para consultar la información publicada por distintos organismos, cambiando únicamente la ruta de acceso.
Durante el desarrollo del proyecto, el Gobierno de Aragón y la Diputación de Huesca dejaron de publicar los datos de los contratos o comenzaron a publicarlos en un formato distinto a RDF, por lo cual la aplicación fue desarrollada únicamente para consultar datos del Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza. Sin embargo, si otros organismos hiciesen públicos los datos de sus contratos, utilizando la ontología PPROC, bastaría con realizar pequeños cambios en la aplicación para poder consultarlos.
Aunque la ontología establece con claridad y precisión la manera en la que se deben publicar los datos, se encontraron algunos errores en la información publicada por el Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza. Éstos, junto con otras deficiencias en los datos, debidas a la falta de estándares, hicieron necesario la introducción de cambios en varias consultas para que mostrasen datos correctos. A pesar de todo, estas consultas funcionarían perfectamente con otro punto de acceso, siempre y cuando los datos publicados fuesen correctos y siguieran un estándar común.
El proyecto fue muy interesante, y si se consigue que más organismos públicos se unan al movimiento Open Data, la aplicación desarrollada podría ser muy útil, ya que por un lado los ciudadanos podrían utilizarla para saber en qué se gasta su dinero y, por otro serviría a los gobernantes para demostrar compromiso con los ciudadanos y transparencia en su gestión.---ABSTRACT---The objective of the project was to develop an application that would show in a clear and understandable way public procurement data from Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza, Gobierno de Aragón and Diputación de Huesca. All these public bodies supported the Open Data project whose objective was to make available to everybody as much information as possible from public institutions, in order to facilitate their use and promote transparency.
These data are published in RDF format and can be queried using SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language).
Public procurement data have to be published according to the rules established by the PPROContology, so one same application can be used to query information from different public bodies, just changing the source from where the data is gathered.
During the development of the project, Gobierno de Aragón and Diputación de Huesca stopped publishing information from public contracts or started publishing it in some other way, so the application was developed only for Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza. Nevertheless, if more public bodies publish data, following the PPROC ontology, only minor changes would need to be made to the application in order to get it working.
Even though the ontology is clear about the way to organize and publish the data, several problems were found while handling the Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza data, either because they did not follow the ontology the right way or because the way they publish some information did not follow any standard and the same data were shown in different ways.

Reusing and building biomedical ontologies requires flexible and versatile tools to manipulate them efficiently, in particular for enriching their axiomatic content.

OPPL augments the ontologists’ toolbox by providing a more efficient, and less error-prone, mechanism for enriching a biomedical ontology than that obtained by a manual treatment.

Results

We present OPPL-Galaxy, a wrapper for using OPPL within Galaxy. The functionality delivered by OPPL (i.e. automated ontology manipulation) can be combined with the tools and workflows devised within the Galaxy framework, resulting in an enhancement of OPPL. Use cases are provided in order to demonstrate OPPL-Galaxy’s capability for enriching, modifying and querying biomedical ontologies.

Either through experience or intuition the reader will already know that the answer is with difficulty or not at all. In this paper we attempt to quantify this difficulty by reproducing a previously published paper for different classes of users (ranging from users with little expertise to domain experts) and suggest ways in which the situation might be improved. Quantification is achieved by estimating the time required to reproduce each of the steps in the method described in the original paper and make them part of an explicit workflow that reproduces the original results. Reproducing the method took several months of effort, and required using new versions and new software that posed challenges to reconstructing and validating the results. The quantification leads to “reproducibility maps” that reveal that novice researchers would only be able to reproduce a few of the steps in the method, and that only expert researchers with advance knowledge of the domain would be able to reproduce the method in its entirety. The workflow itself is published as an online resource together with supporting software and data. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the complexities of requiring reproducibility in terms of cost versus benefit, and a desiderata with our observations and guidelines for improving reproducibility.

Nevertheless, multilingual semantic applications are still rare, owing to the fact that most online ontologies are monolingual in English. In order to solve this issue, techniques for ontology localisation and translation are needed. However, traditional machine translation is difficult to apply to ontologies, owing to the fact that ontology labels tend to be quite short in length and linguistically different from the free text paradigm. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance machine translation of ontologies based on exploiting the well-structured concept descriptions contained in the ontology. In particular, our approach leverages the semantics contained in the ontology by using Cross Lingual Explicit Semantic Analysis (CLESA) for context-based disambiguation in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).

In addition to the above, some approaches address how to improve the quality of the datasets through a repair process that focuses on how to correct invalidities caused by constraint violations by either removing or adding triples.

Importing ontologies or referring to their terms’ URIs are the two main ways to reuse knowledge from available ontologies. In this paper, we have analyzed 18589 terms appearing within 196 ontologies in-cluded in the Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) registry with the aim of under-standing the current state of ontology reuse in the LD context.

1.	INTRODUCTION. LINGUISTIC TOOLS AND ANNOTATIONS: THEIR LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
Computational Linguistics is already a consolidated research area. It builds upon the results of other two major ones, namely Linguistics and Computer Science and Engineering, and it aims at developing computational models of human language (or natural language, as it is termed in this area). Possibly, its most well-known applications are the different tools developed so far for processing human language, such as machine translation systems and speech recognizers or dictation programs.
These tools for processing human language are commonly referred to as linguistic tools. Apart from the examples mentioned above, there are also other types of linguistic tools that perhaps are not so well-known, but on which most of the other applications of Computational Linguistics are built. These other types of linguistic tools comprise POS taggers, natural language parsers and semantic taggers, amongst others. All of them can be termed linguistic annotation tools.
Linguistic annotation tools are important assets. In fact, POS and semantic taggers (and, to a lesser extent, also natural language parsers) have become critical resources for the computer applications that process natural language. Hence, any computer application that has to analyse a text automatically and ‘intelligently’ will include at least a module for POS tagging. The more an application needs to ‘understand’ the meaning of the text it processes, the more linguistic tools and/or modules it will incorporate and integrate.
However, linguistic annotation tools have still some limitations, which can be summarised as follows:
1.	Normally, they perform annotations only at a certain linguistic level (that is, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, etc.).
2.	They usually introduce a certain rate of errors and ambiguities when tagging. This error rate ranges from 10 percent up to 50 percent of the units annotated for unrestricted, general texts.
3.	Their annotations are most frequently formulated in terms of an annotation schema designed and implemented ad hoc.
A priori, it seems that the interoperation and the integration of several linguistic tools into an appropriate software architecture could most likely solve the limitations stated in (1). Besides, integrating several linguistic annotation tools and making them interoperate could also minimise the limitation stated in (2). Nevertheless, in the latter case, all these tools should produce annotations for a common level, which would have to be combined in order to correct their corresponding errors and inaccuracies. Yet, the limitation stated in (3) prevents both types of integration and interoperation from being easily achieved. 
In addition, most high-level annotation tools rely on other lower-level annotation tools and their outputs to generate their own ones. For example, sense-tagging tools (operating at the semantic level) often use POS taggers (operating at a lower level, i.e., the morphosyntactic) to identify the grammatical category of the word or lexical unit they are annotating. Accordingly, if a faulty or inaccurate low-level annotation tool is to be used by other higher-level one in its process, the errors and inaccuracies of the former should be minimised in advance. Otherwise, these errors and inaccuracies would be transferred to (and even magnified in) the annotations of the high-level annotation tool.
Therefore, it would be quite useful to find a way to
(i)	correct or, at least, reduce the errors and the inaccuracies of lower-level linguistic tools; 
(ii)	unify the annotation schemas of different linguistic annotation tools or, more generally speaking, make these tools (as well as their annotations) interoperate.
Clearly, solving (i) and (ii) should ease the automatic annotation of web pages by means of linguistic tools, and their transformation into Semantic Web pages (Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila, 2001). Yet, as stated above, (ii) is a type of interoperability problem. There again, ontologies (Gruber, 1993; Borst, 1997) have been successfully applied thus far to solve several interoperability problems. Hence, ontologies should help solve also the problems and limitations of linguistic annotation tools aforementioned.
Thus, to summarise, the main aim of the present work was to combine somehow these separated approaches, mechanisms and tools for annotation from Linguistics and Ontological Engineering (and the Semantic Web) in a sort of hybrid (linguistic and ontological) annotation model, suitable for both areas. This hybrid (semantic) annotation model should (a) benefit from the advances, models, techniques, mechanisms and tools of these two areas; (b) minimise (and even solve, when possible) some of the problems found in each of them; and (c) be suitable for the Semantic Web. The concrete goals that helped attain this aim are presented in the following section.
2.	GOALS OF THE PRESENT WORK
As mentioned above, the main goal of this work was to specify a hybrid (that is, linguistically-motivated and ontology-based) model of annotation suitable for the Semantic Web (i.e. it had to produce a semantic annotation of web page contents). This entailed that the tags included in the annotations of the model had to (1) represent linguistic concepts (or linguistic categories, as they are termed in ISO/DCR (2008)), in order for this model to be linguistically-motivated; (2) be ontological terms (i.e., use an ontological vocabulary), in order for the model to be ontology-based; and (3) be structured (linked) as a collection of ontology-based <Subject, Predicate, Object> triples, as in the usual Semantic Web languages (namely RDF(S) and OWL), in order for the model to be considered suitable for the Semantic Web.
Besides, to be useful for the Semantic Web, this model should provide a way to automate the annotation of web pages. As for the present work, this requirement involved reusing the linguistic annotation tools purchased by the OEG research group (http://www.oeg-upm.net), but solving beforehand (or, at least, minimising) some of their limitations. Therefore, this model had to minimise these limitations by means of the integration of several linguistic annotation tools into a common architecture. Since this integration required the interoperation of tools and their annotations, ontologies were proposed as the main technological component to make them effectively interoperate. From the very beginning, it seemed that the formalisation of the elements and the knowledge underlying linguistic annotations within an appropriate set of ontologies would be a great step forward towards the formulation of such a model (henceforth referred to as OntoTag).
Obviously, first, to combine the results of the linguistic annotation tools that operated at the same level, their annotation schemas had to be unified (or, preferably, standardised) in advance. This entailed the unification (id. standardisation) of their tags (both their representation and their meaning), and their format or syntax. Second, to merge the results of the linguistic annotation tools operating at different levels, their respective annotation schemas had to be (a) made interoperable and (b) integrated. And third, in order for the resulting annotations to suit the Semantic Web, they had to be specified by means of an ontology-based vocabulary, and structured by means of ontology-based <Subject, Predicate, Object> triples, as hinted above. Therefore, a new annotation scheme had to be devised, based both on ontologies and on this type of triples, which allowed for the combination and the integration of the annotations of any set of linguistic annotation tools. This annotation scheme was considered a fundamental part of the model proposed here, and its development was, accordingly, another major objective of the present work.
All these goals, aims and objectives could be re-stated more clearly as follows:
Goal 1:	Development of a set of ontologies for the formalisation of the linguistic knowledge relating linguistic annotation.
Sub-goal 1.1:	Ontological formalisation of the EAGLES (1996a; 1996b) de facto standards for morphosyntactic and syntactic annotation, in a way that helps respect the <Unit, Attribute, Value> triple structure recommended for annotations in these works (which is isomorphic to the <Subject, Predicate, Object> triple structures used in the context of the Semantic Web).
Sub-goal 1.2:	Incorporation into this preliminary ontological formalisation of other existing standards and standard proposals relating the levels mentioned above, such as those currently under development within ISO/TC 37 (the ISO Technical Committee dealing with Terminology, which deals also with linguistic resources and annotations).
Sub-goal 1.3:	Generalisation and extension of the recommendations in EAGLES (1996a; 1996b) and ISO/TC 37 to the semantic level, for which no ISO/TC 37 standards have been developed yet.
Sub-goal 1.4:	Ontological formalisation of the generalisations and/or extensions obtained in the previous sub-goal as generalisations and/or extensions of the corresponding ontology (or ontologies).
Sub-goal 1.5:	Ontological formalisation of the knowledge required to link, combine and unite the knowledge represented in the previously developed ontology (or ontologies).
Goal 2:	Development of OntoTag’s annotation scheme, a standard-based abstract scheme  for the hybrid (linguistically-motivated and ontological-based) annotation of texts.
Sub-goal 2.1:	Development of the standard-based morphosyntactic annotation level of OntoTag’s scheme. This level should include, and possibly extend, the recommendations of EAGLES (1996a) and also the recommendations included in the ISO/MAF (2008) standard draft.
Sub-goal 2.2:	Development of the standard-based syntactic annotation level of the hybrid abstract scheme. This level should include, and possibly extend, the recommendations of EAGLES (1996b) and the ISO/SynAF (2010) standard draft.
Sub-goal 2.3:	Development of the standard-based semantic annotation level of OntoTag’s (abstract) scheme.
Sub-goal 2.4:	Development of the mechanisms for a convenient integration of the three annotation levels already mentioned. These mechanisms should take into account the recommendations included in the ISO/LAF (2009) standard draft.
Goal 3:	Design of OntoTag’s (abstract) annotation architecture, an abstract architecture for the hybrid (semantic) annotation of texts (i) that facilitates the integration and interoperation of different linguistic annotation tools, and (ii) whose results comply with OntoTag’s annotation scheme.
Sub-goal 3.1:	Specification of the decanting processes that allow for the classification and separation, according to their corresponding levels, of the results of the linguistic tools annotating at several different levels.
Sub-goal 3.2:	Specification of the standardisation processes that allow (a) complying with the standardisation requirements of OntoTag’s annotation scheme, as well as (b) combining the results of those linguistic tools that share some level of annotation.
Sub-goal 3.3:	Specification of the merging processes that allow for the combination of the output annotations and the interoperation of those linguistic tools that share some level of annotation.
Sub-goal 3.4:	Specification of the merge processes that allow for the integration of the results and the interoperation of those tools performing their annotations at different levels.
Goal 4:	Generation of OntoTagger’s schema, a concrete instance of OntoTag’s abstract scheme for a concrete set of linguistic annotations. These linguistic annotations result from the tools and the resources available in the research group, namely 
•	Bitext’s DataLexica (http://www.bitext.com/EN/datalexica.asp),
•	LACELL’s (POS) tagger (http://www.um.es/grupos/grupo-lacell/quees.php),
•	Connexor’s FDG (http://www.connexor.eu/technology/machinese/glossary/fdg/), and
•	EuroWordNet (Vossen et al., 1998).
This schema should help evaluate OntoTag’s underlying hypotheses, stated below. Consequently, it should implement, at least, those levels of the abstract scheme dealing with the annotations of the set of tools considered in this implementation. This includes the morphosyntactic, the syntactic and the semantic levels.
Goal 5:	Implementation of OntoTagger’s configuration, a concrete instance of OntoTag’s abstract architecture for this set of linguistic tools and annotations. This configuration (1) had to use the schema generated in the previous goal; and (2) should help support or refute the hypotheses of this work as well (see the next section).
Sub-goal 5.1:	Implementation of the decanting processes that facilitate the classification and separation of the results of those linguistic resources that provide annotations at several different levels (on the one hand, LACELL’s tagger operates at the morphosyntactic level and, minimally, also at the semantic level; on the other hand, FDG operates at the morphosyntactic and the syntactic levels and, minimally, at the semantic level as well).
Sub-goal 5.2:	Implementation of the standardisation processes that allow (i) specifying the results of those linguistic tools that share some level of annotation according to the requirements of OntoTagger’s schema, as well as (ii) combining these shared level results. In particular, all the tools selected perform morphosyntactic annotations and they had to be conveniently combined by means of these processes.
Sub-goal 5.3:	Implementation of the merging processes that allow for the combination (and possibly the improvement) of the annotations and the interoperation of the tools that share some level of annotation (in particular, those relating the morphosyntactic level, as in the previous sub-goal).
Sub-goal 5.4:	Implementation of the merging processes that allow for the integration of the different standardised and combined annotations aforementioned, relating all the levels considered.
Sub-goal 5.5:	Improvement of the semantic level of this configuration by adding a named entity recognition, (sub-)classification and annotation subsystem, which also uses the named entities annotated to populate a domain ontology, in order to provide a concrete application of the present work in the two areas involved (the Semantic Web and Corpus Linguistics).

3.	MAIN RESULTS: ASSESSMENT OF ONTOTAG’S UNDERLYING HYPOTHESES
The model developed in the present thesis tries to shed some light on (i) whether linguistic annotation tools can effectively interoperate; (ii) whether their results can be combined and integrated; and, if they can, (iii) how they can, respectively, interoperate and be combined and integrated. Accordingly, several hypotheses had to be supported (or rejected) by the development of the OntoTag model and OntoTagger (its implementation).
The hypotheses underlying OntoTag are surveyed below. Only one of the hypotheses (H.6) was rejected; the other five could be confirmed.
H.1	The annotations of different levels (or layers) can be integrated into a sort of overall, comprehensive, multilayer and multilevel annotation, so that their elements can complement and refer to each other.
•	CONFIRMED by the development of:
o	OntoTag’s annotation scheme,
o	OntoTag’s annotation architecture,
o	OntoTagger’s (XML, RDF, OWL) annotation schemas,
o	OntoTagger’s configuration.
H.2	Tool-dependent annotations can be mapped onto a sort of tool-independent annotations and, thus, can be standardised.
•	CONFIRMED by means of the standardisation phase incorporated into OntoTag and OntoTagger for the annotations yielded by the tools.
H.3	Standardisation should ease:
H.3.1:	The interoperation of linguistic tools.
H.3.2:	The comparison, combination (at the same level and layer) and integration (at different levels or layers) of annotations.
•	H.3 was CONFIRMED by means of the development of OntoTagger’s ontology-based configuration:
o	Interoperation, comparison, combination and integration of the annotations of three different linguistic tools (Connexor’s FDG, Bitext’s DataLexica and LACELL’s tagger);
o	Integration of EuroWordNet-based, domain-ontology-based and named entity annotations at the semantic level.
o	Integration of morphosyntactic, syntactic and semantic annotations.
H.4	Ontologies and Semantic Web technologies (can) play a crucial role in the standardisation of linguistic annotations, by providing consensual vocabularies and standardised formats for annotation (e.g., RDF triples).
•	CONFIRMED by means of the development of OntoTagger’s RDF-triple-based annotation schemas.
H.5	The rate of errors introduced by a linguistic tool at a given level, when annotating, can be reduced automatically by contrasting and combining its results with the ones coming from other tools, operating at the same level. However, these other tools might be built following a different technological (stochastic vs. rule-based, for example) or theoretical (dependency vs. HPS-grammar-based, for instance) approach.
•	CONFIRMED by the results yielded by the evaluation of OntoTagger.
H.6	Each linguistic level can be managed and annotated independently.
•	REJECTED: OntoTagger’s experiments and the dependencies observed among the morphosyntactic annotations, and between them and the syntactic annotations.
In fact, Hypothesis H.6 was already rejected when OntoTag’s ontologies were developed. We observed then that several linguistic units stand on an interface between levels, belonging thereby to both of them (such as morphosyntactic units, which belong to both the morphological level and the syntactic level). Therefore, the annotations of these levels overlap and cannot be handled independently when merged into a unique multileveled annotation.

4.	OTHER MAIN RESULTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS 
First, interoperability is a hot topic for both the linguistic annotation community and the whole Computer Science field. The specification (and implementation) of OntoTag’s architecture for the combination and integration of linguistic (annotation) tools and annotations by means of ontologies shows a way to make these different linguistic annotation tools and annotations interoperate in practice.
Second, as mentioned above, the elements involved in linguistic annotation were formalised in a set (or network) of ontologies (OntoTag’s linguistic ontologies).
•	On the one hand, OntoTag’s network of ontologies consists of
−	The Linguistic Unit Ontology (LUO), which includes a mostly hierarchical formalisation of the different types of linguistic elements (i.e., units) identifiable in a written text;
−	The Linguistic Attribute Ontology (LAO), which includes also a mostly hierarchical formalisation of the different types of features that characterise the linguistic units included in the LUO;
−	The Linguistic Value Ontology (LVO), which includes the corresponding formalisation of the different values that the attributes in the LAO can take;
−	The OIO (OntoTag’s Integration Ontology), which
	Includes the knowledge required to link, combine and unite the knowledge represented in the LUO, the LAO and the LVO;
	Can be viewed as a knowledge representation ontology that describes the most elementary vocabulary used in the area of annotation.
•	On the other hand, OntoTag’s ontologies incorporate the knowledge included in the different standards and recommendations for linguistic annotation released so far, such as those developed within the EAGLES and the SIMPLE European projects or by the ISO/TC 37 committee:
−	As far as morphosyntactic annotations are concerned, OntoTag’s ontologies formalise the terms in the EAGLES (1996a) recommendations and their corresponding terms within the ISO Morphosyntactic Annotation Framework (ISO/MAF, 2008) standard;
−	As for syntactic annotations, OntoTag’s ontologies incorporate the terms in the EAGLES (1996b) recommendations and their corresponding terms within the ISO Syntactic Annotation Framework (ISO/SynAF, 2010) standard draft;
−	Regarding semantic annotations, OntoTag’s ontologies generalise and extend the recommendations in EAGLES (1996a; 1996b) and, since no stable standards or standard drafts have been released for semantic annotation by ISO/TC 37 yet, they incorporate the terms in SIMPLE (2000) instead;
−	The terms coming from all these recommendations and standards were supplemented by those within the ISO Data Category Registry (ISO/DCR, 2008)  and also of the ISO Linguistic Annotation Framework (ISO/LAF, 2009) standard draft when developing OntoTag’s ontologies.
Third, we showed that the combination of the results of tools annotating at the same level can yield better results (both in precision and in recall) than each tool separately. In particular,
1.	OntoTagger clearly outperformed two of the tools integrated into its configuration, namely DataLexica and FDG in all the combination sub-phases in which they overlapped (i.e. POS tagging, lemma annotation and morphological feature annotation). As far as the remaining tool is concerned, i.e. LACELL’s tagger, it was also outperformed by OntoTagger in POS tagging and lemma annotation, and it did not behave better than OntoTagger in the morphological feature annotation layer.
2.	As an immediate result, this implies that
a)	This type of combination architecture configurations can be applied in order to improve significantly the accuracy of linguistic annotations; and
b)	Concerning the morphosyntactic level, this could be regarded as a way of constructing more robust and more accurate POS tagging systems.
Fourth, Semantic Web annotations are usually performed by humans or else by machine learning systems. Both of them leave much to be desired: the former, with respect to their annotation rate; the latter, with respect to their (average) precision and recall. In this work, we showed how linguistic tools can be wrapped in order to annotate automatically Semantic Web pages using ontologies. This entails their fast, robust and accurate semantic annotation.
As a way of example, as mentioned in Sub-goal 5.5, we developed a particular OntoTagger module for the recognition, classification and labelling of named entities, according to the MUC and ACE tagsets (Chinchor, 1997; Doddington et al., 2004). These tagsets were further specified by means of a domain ontology, namely the Cinema Named Entities Ontology (CNEO). This module was applied to the automatic annotation of ten different web pages containing cinema reviews (that is, around 5000 words). In addition, the named entities annotated with this module were also labelled as instances (or individuals) of the classes included in the CNEO and, then, were used to populate this domain ontology.
•	The statistical results obtained from the evaluation of this particular module of OntoTagger can be summarised as follows. On the one hand, as far as recall (R) is concerned, (R.1) the lowest value was 76,40% (for file 7); (R.2) the highest value was 97, 50% (for file 3); and (R.3) the average value was 88,73%. On the other hand, as far as the precision rate (P) is concerned, (P.1) its minimum was 93,75% (for file 4); (R.2) its maximum was 100% (for files 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10); and (R.3) its average value was 98,99%.
•	These results, which apply to the tasks of named entity annotation and ontology population, are extraordinary good for both of them.  They can be explained on the basis of the high accuracy of the annotations provided by OntoTagger at the lower levels (mainly at the morphosyntactic level). However, they should be conveniently qualified, since they might be too domain- and/or language-dependent. It should be further experimented how our approach works in a different domain or a different language, such as French, English, or German.
•	In any case, the results of this application of Human Language Technologies to Ontology Population (and, accordingly, to Ontological Engineering) seem very promising and encouraging in order for these two areas to collaborate and complement each other in the area of semantic annotation.
Fifth, as shown in the State of the Art of this work, there are different approaches and models for the semantic annotation of texts, but all of them focus on a particular view of the semantic level. Clearly, all these approaches and models should be integrated in order to bear a coherent and joint semantic annotation level. OntoTag shows how (i) these semantic annotation layers could be integrated together; and (ii) they could be integrated with the annotations associated to other annotation levels.
Sixth, we identified some recommendations, best practices and lessons learned for annotation standardisation, interoperation and merge. They show how standardisation (via ontologies, in this case) enables the combination, integration and interoperation of different linguistic tools and their annotations into a multilayered (or multileveled) linguistic annotation, which is one of the hot topics in the area of Linguistic Annotation.
And last but not least, OntoTag’s annotation scheme and OntoTagger’s annotation schemas show a way to formalise and annotate coherently and uniformly the different units and features associated to the different levels and layers of linguistic annotation. This is a great scientific step ahead towards the global standardisation of this area, which is the aim of ISO/TC 37 (in particular, Subcommittee 4, dealing with the standardisation of linguistic annotations and resources).",completed,2012-07-26,,,,,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,,https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/providing-linked-linguistic-and-semantic-web-annotations/isbn/978-3-659-25526-7,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/13827,,,,,,,,"•	Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J. and Lassila, O.

article,Challenges for the Multilingual Web of Data,none,pub,public,,"Multilingualism, Web of Data, Linked Data",oeg,"The Web has witnessed an enormous growth in the amount of semantic information published in recent years. This growth has been stimulated to a large extent by the emergence of Linked Data. Although this brings us a big step closer to the vision of a Semantic Web, it also raises new issues such as the need for dealing with information expressed in different natural languages. Indeed, although the Web of Data can contain any kind of information in any language, it still lacks explicit mechanisms to automatically reconcile such information when it is expressed in different languages. This leads to situations in which data expressed in a certain language is not easily accessible to speakers of other languages. The Web of Data shows the potential for being extended to a truly multilingual web as vocabularies and data can be published in a language-independent fashion, while associated language-dependent (linguistic) information supporting the access across languages can be stored separately. In this sense, the multilingual Web of Data can be realized in our view as a layer of services and resources on top of the existing Linked Data infrastructure adding i) linguistic information for data and vocabularies in different languages, ii) mappings between data with labels in different languages, and iii) services to dynamically access and traverse Linked Data across different languages. In this article we present this vision of a multilingual Web of Data. We discuss challenges that need to be addressed to make this vision come true and discuss the role that techniques such as ontology localization, ontology mapping, and cross-lingual ontology-based information access and presentation will play in achieving this. Further, we propose an initial architecture and describe a roadmap that can provide a basis for the implementation of this vision.",published,2012-03,,,,,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/14462,,Journal of Web Semantics,11,63-71,1570-8268,,,,,,,,,0,,,

One of the most important aspects of “Lexical Linked Data” is the sharing of lexica and machine readable dictionaries. It is for this reason, that the lemon format has been proposed, which we briefly describe. We then consider two resources that seem ideal candidates for the Linked Data cloud, namely WordNet 3.0 and Wiktionary, a large document based dictionary. We discuss the challenges of converting both resources to lemon , and in particular for Wiktionary, the challenge of processing the mark-up, and handling inconsistencies and underspecification in the source material.

The context in which we consider these activities is that of a networked world, where reuse of existing resources is commonplace, ontologies are developed collaboratively, and managing relationships between ontologies becomes an essential aspect of the ontological engineering process. The description of both the methodology and the ontology engineering activities is grounded in a comprehensive software environment, the NeOn Toolkit and its plugins, which provides integrated support for all the activities described in the book. Here we provide an introduction for the whole book, while the rest of the content is organized into 4 parts: (1) the NeOn Methodology Framework, (2) the set of ontology engineering activities, (3) the NeOn Toolkit and plugins, and (4) three use cases.

thesis,Software quality model for the evaluation of semantic technologies,none,unpub,public,,oeg,Ontology Engineering Group – OEG,"In order to obtain high-quality software products, the specification and evaluation of quality during the software development process is of crucial importance. One important component in software evaluation is the software quality model, since it provides the basis for software evaluation and gives a better insight of the software characteristics that influence its quality. Furthermore, quality models also ensure a consistent terminology for software product quality and provide guidance for its measurement.
In recent years, semantic technologies have started to gain importance and, as the field becomes more and more popular, the number of these technologies is increasing exponentially. Just as with any other software product, the quality of semantic technologies is an important concern, and multiple evaluations of semantic technologies have been performed. However, the problem is that there is no consistent terminology for describing the quality of semantic technologies and it is difficult to compare them because of differences in the meaning of the evaluation characteristics used. Also, existing software quality models do not define those quality characteristics that are specific to semantic technologies. 
This thesis presents a quality model for semantic technologies which aims to provide a common ground in the field of semantic technology evaluation. It also presents a new method for extending software quality models, based on a bottom-up approach, that is used to define the quality model for semantic technologies. Finally, this thesis describes the use of the semantic technology quality model in a web application that visualizes semantic technology evaluation results and provides semantic technology recommendations.",published,2011-06-21,,,,,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/10186,,,,,,,,,,,,masters,Investigación en Inteligencia Artificial,0,,,

amounts of data about the real world that surrounds us, measuring a wide range of physical properties in real time. However, in large-scale deployments it becomes hard to eectively exploit the data captured by the sensors, since there is no precise information about what devices are available and what properties they measure. Even when metadata is available, users need to know low-level details such as database schemas or names of properties that are specic to a device or platform. Therefore the task of coherently searching, correlating and combining sensor data becomes very challenging. We propose an ontology-based approach, that consists in exposing sensor observations in terms of ontologies enriched with semantic metadata, providing information such as: which sensor recorded what, where, when, and in which conditions. For this, we allow dening virtual semantic streams, whose ontological terms are related to the underlying sensor data schemas through declarative mappings, and can be queried in terms of a high level sensor network ontology.",published,2011,4th International Workshop on Semantic Sensor Networks 2011 in ISWC 2011,"Bonn, Germany",23 Octubre 2011,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,Proceedings: 4th International Workshop on Semantic Sensor Networks 2011,http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Workshops/SSN/ssn2.pdf,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/10294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,

article,Challenges for the Multilingual Web of Data,none,submitted,public,,oeg,Ontology Engineering Group – OEG,"The Web has witnessed an enormous growth in the amount of semantic information published in recent years. This growth has been stimulated to a large extent by the emergence of Linked Data. Although this brings us a big step closer to the vision of a Semantic Web, it also raises new issues such as the need for dealing with information expressed in different natural languages. Indeed, although the Web of Data can contain any kind of information in any language, it still lacks explicit mechanisms to automatically reconcile such information when it is expressed in ifferent languages. This leads to situations in which data expressed in a certain language is not easily accessible to speakers of other languages.
The Web of Data shows the potential for being extended to a truly multilingual web as vocabularies and data can be published in a language-independent fashion, while associated language-dependent (linguistic) information supporting the access across languages can be stored separately. In this sense, the multilingual Web of Data can be realized in our view as a layer of services and resources on top of the existing Linked Data infrastructure adding i) linguistic information for data and vocabularies in different languages, ii) mappings between data with labels in different languages, and iii) services to dynamically access and traverse Linked Data across different languages.
In this article we present this vision of a multilingual Web of Data. We discuss challenges that need to be addressed to make this vision come true and discuss the role that techniques such as ontology localization, ontology mapping, and cross-lingual ontology-based information access and presentation will play in achieving this. Further, we propose an initial architecture and describe a roadmap that can provide a basis for the implementation of this vision.",submitted,2011,,,,,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,,,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/8848,,International Jounal on Semantic Web and Information Systems,,,1552-6283,,,,,,,,,0,,,

Abstract  The main objective of this PhD thesis focuses on the ontology-based integration of information related to geospatial heterogeneous databases with the purpose of providing an integrated view of the stored information into different datasets.  Nowadays, there are different proposals for ontology-based integration information. Nevertheless, there is not a methodology that might be applied to the geographical information realm. This issue involves, at least, four important limitations in information integration processing:  The existing proposals are not easily replicable.  It is not easy to understand the characteristics of the approaches proposed.  The integration scenarios are restricted to similar datasets, use cases, and problems.  Planification tasks do not perform in a right way.   These limitations prove that there exists a need for a methodological approach to face the ontology-based integration of geospatial heterogeneous information. In this sense, this work proposes the following contributions:  Firstly, we have provided a methodological approach for ontology-based integration of geospatial information. This approach has been applied to a use case in the hydrographical information context.  Besides, we have developed several domain and multilingual ontological resources in the hydrographical realm. These resources have been used for generating seven RDF datasets, which include geometrical characteristics as a particular trait of geospatial data.  Moreover, we have published the Spanish hydrographical information according to the Linked Data principles. This initiative contributes to enrich the Web of Data with geospatial data in the Spanish language.  Finally, we have provided different heuristic approaches for discovering duplicate instances into heterogeneous RDF datasets.  The validity of these contributions has been supported by a use case (hydrographical information) and by a set of experiments performs. The obtained results reveal the applicability of the methodological approach and the feasibility of models (ontologies) and techniques (heuristic approaches).

thesis,Method for Reusing and Re-engineering Non-ontological Resources for Building Ontologies,by-nc-nd,unpub,public,,,oeg,"This thesis is focused on the reuse and possible subsequent re-engineering of knowledge resources, as opposed to custom-building new ontologies from scratch. The deep analysis of the state of the art has revealed that there are some methods and tools in the literature for transforming non-ontological resources into ontologies, but with some limitations: _ Most of the methods presented are based on ad-hoc transformations for the resource type, and the resource implementation. _ Only a few take advantage of the resource data model, an important artifact for the re-engineering process [GGPSFVT08]. _ There is no any integrated framework, method or corresponding tool, that considers the resources types, data models and implementations identified in an unified way. _ With regard to the transformation approach, the majority of the methods perform a TBox transformation, many others perform an ABox transformation and some perform a population. However, no method includes the possibility to perform the three transformation approaches. _ Regarding to the degree of automation, almost all the methods perform a semi-automatic transformation of the resource. _ According to the explicitation of the hidden semantics in the relations of the resource components, we can state that the methods that perform a TBox transformation make explicit the semantics in the relations of the resource components. Most of those methods identify subClassOf relations, others identify ad-hoc relations, and some identify partOf relations. However, only a few methods make explicit the three types of relations. _ With respect to how the methods make explicit the hidden semantics in the relations of the resource terms, we can say that three methods rely on the domain expert for making explicit the semantics, and two rely on an external resource, e.g., DOLCE ontology. Moreover, there are two methods that rely on external resources but not for making explicit the hidden semantics, but for finding out a proper ontology for populating it. _ According to the provision of the methodological guidelines, almost all the methods provide methodological guidelines for the transformation. However these guidelines are not finely detailed; for instance, they do not provide information about who is in charge of performing a particular activity/task, nor when that activity/task has to be carried out. _ With regard to the techniques employed, most of the methods do not mention them at all. Only a few methods specify techniques as transformation rules, lexico-syntactic patterns, mapping rules and natural language techniques. In this thesis we have provided a method and its technological support that rely on re-engineering patterns in order to speed up the ontology development process by reusing and re-engineering as much as possible available non-ontological resources. To achieve this overall goal, we have decomposed it in the following objectives: (1) the definition of methodological aspects related with the reuse of non-ontolo-gical resource for building ontologies; (2) the definition of methodological aspects related with the re-engineering of non-ontological resources for building ontologies; (3) the creation of a library of patterns for re-engineering nonontological resources into ontologies; and (4) the development of a software library that implements the suggestions given by the re-engineering patterns. Having in mind these goals, in this chapter we present how the open research problems identified in Chapter 2 are solved by the main thesis contributions. Then, we discuss the verification of our hypotheses, and finally we provide an outlook for the future work in those topics.",completed,2011,,,,,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/6338,,,,,,,,,,250,,phd,,0,,,

article,"A framework and computer system for knowledge-level acquisition, representation, and reasoning with process knowledge",none,pub,public,,oeg,Ontology Engineering Group – OEG,"The development of knowledge-based systems is usually approached through the combined skills of software and knowledge engineers (SEs and KEs, respectively) and of subject matter experts (SMEs). One of the most critical steps in this task aims at transferring knowledge from SMEs’ expertise to formal, machine-readable representations, which allow systems to reason with such knowledge. However, this process is costly and error prone. Alleviating such knowledge acquisition bottleneck requires enabling SMEs with the means to produce the target knowledge representations, minimizing the intervention of KEs. This is especially difficult in the case of complex knowledge types like processes. The analysis of scientific domains like Biology, Chemistry, and Physics uncovers: (i) that process knowledge is the single most frequent type of knowledge occurring in such domains and (ii) specific solutions need to be devised in order to allow SMEs to represent it in a computational form. We present a framework and computer system for the acquisition and representation of process knowledge in scientific domains by SMEs. We propose methods and techniques to enable SMEs to acquire process knowledge from the domains, to formally represent it, and to reason about it. We have developed an abstract process metamodel and a library of problem solving methods (PSMs), which support these tasks, respectively providing the terminology for SME-tailored process diagrams and an abstract formalization of the strategies needed for reasoning about processes. We have implemented this approach as part of the DarkMatter system and formally evaluated it in the context of the intermediate evaluation of Project Halo, an initiative aiming at the creation of question answering systems by SMEs.",published,2010-10,,,,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.05.004,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/5633,Elsevier,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,68,641-668,1071-5819,,,,,,,,,0,10,,

defined as solutions to ontological design problems, are of great help to
developers when modelling ontologies since these patterns provide a
development guide and improve the quality of the resulting ontologies.
However, it has been demonstrated that, in many cases, developers encounter
difficulties when they have to reuse the correct design patterns and include
errors in the modelling. Thus, to avoid pitfalls in ontology modelling, this paper
proposes classifying errors into two types: (1) errors related to existing ODPs,
called anti-patterns, and (2) errors not related to existing ODPs, called pitfalls.
This classification is the result of analysing a set of ontologies. This paper is
focused on the pitfalls identified during the analysis. In addition the paper

This paper presents three hydrographical ontologies (which are built using top-down and bottom-up approaches) and an approach to comparing them; the goal of this approach is to prove which ontologies have a better coverage of the domain.

Ontology development has transformed from a process normally performed by one ontology engineer into a process performed collaboratively by a team of ontology engineers, who may be geographically distributed and play different roles. For example, editors may propose changes, while authoritative users approve or reject them following a well defined process. This process, however, has only been partially addressed by existing ontology development methods, methodologies, and tool support. Furthermore, in a distributed environment where ontology editors may be working on local copies of the same ontology, strategies should be in place to ensure that changes in one copy are reflected in all of them.

1	El desarrollo de una red de ontologías basada en Lógica Descriptiva que representa el conocimiento relacionado con el Camino de Santiago. Dicho camino de peregrinación involucra dominios tan diversos como el arte, la geografía, la arquitectura, etc. El objetivo de esta red de ontologías es permitir el acceso y la edición de información referente al Camino de Santiago.
Esta red de ontologías se ha desarrollado en el contexto del proyecto nacional GeoBuddies: Anotación semántica colaborativa con dispositivos móviles en el Camino de Santiago (TSI2007-65677-C02) (http://www.geobuddies.net/). 
La red de ontologías, cuyo desarrollo se ha realizado basándose en la NeOn Methodology [3], está formada por once módulos que tratan los siguientes subdominios: arquitectura, arte, geografía, GML (Geography Markup Language), gustos, lenguajes, personas, precio, servicios comunitarios, tiempo y unidades de medida. Dicha red de ontología se incluirá en el segundo prototipo de la plataforma Geobuddies para la recuperación y edición de información acerca del Camino de Santiago.
2. El desarrollo de unas guías metodológicas preliminares para la creación de redes de ontologías basadas en la experiencia y los problemas encontrados a lo largo del desarrollo de la red de ontologías para el Camino de Santiago.
Estas guías pretenden orientar a un usuario inexperto en la creación de redes de ontologías sobre cómo disponer la estructura de la red de ontologías.
3. El desarrollo de unas guías metodológicas preliminares para evitar el uso de malas prácticas o antipatrones durante la modelización de ontologías.
El modelado de ontologías se ha convertido por la dificultad que conlleva en uno de los principales temas de investigación en el área de la ingeniería ontológica. Además, en el campo de la ingeniería ontológica se ha demostrado [1, 2] que los desarrolladores de ontologías tienen dificultades para reutilizar patrones de diseño correctos durante la modelización, incluyendo en estos casos errores en los modelos. Por lo tanto, se necesita un mejor soporte para entender y usar correctamente los patrones de diseño ontológico, evitando de este modo la aparición de errores de modelado. 
Estas guías preliminares consisten en la descripción de unas malas prácticas, unas indicaciones de cómo podrían detectarse, un ejemplo en el que se encontró dicha mala práctica y una posible solución para evitar la mala práctica.
Las guías metodológicas que se aportan en el proyecto final de carrera tienen como objetivo ayudar a los desarrolladores de ontologías a construir ontologías reutilizando buenas prácticas y evitando la inclusión de errores de modelado.",published,2009-03,,,,,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,,,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/3135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,

Thus, no software for this task has been built until now. This paper presents a tool, OntologyTest, designed to overcome this drawback. The tool allows the user to define a set of tests to check the ontology’s functional requirements, to execute them, and to inspect the results of the execution.

However, tag-based sharing and retrieval is not optimal due to the fact that tags are plain text labels without an explicit or formal meaning, and hence polysemy and synonymy should be dealt with appropriately. To ameliorate these problems, we propose a context-based tag disambiguation algorithm that selects the meaning of a tag among a set of candidate DBpedia entries, using a common information retrieval similarity measure. The most similar DBpedia en-try is selected as the one representing the meaning of the tag.

The Ontology Engineering Group (OEG) is working with IGN-E to attain this objective in two phases: first, by creating automatically an ontology using the semantics of catalogues sections, and second, by discovering mappings automatically that can relate ontology concepts to database instances. So, these mappings are the instruments to break the syntactic, semantic and granularity heterogeneity gap. We have developed software for building a first ontology version and for discovering automatically mappings using techniques that take into account all types of heterogeneity. The ontology contains a set of extra-attributes which are identified in the building process. The ontology, called PhenomenOntology, will be reviewed by domain experts of IGN-E. The automatic mapping discovery will be also used for discovering new knowledge that will be added to the ontology. For increasing the usability and giving independence to different parts, the processes of each phase will be designed automatically and as upgradeable as possible.",published,2008-06-23,The 13th International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling (SDH 2008),"Montpellier, Francia",23-25 de junio de 2008,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,The 13th International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling (SDH 2008),,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/5112,,,,,,,978-3-540-68565-4,,,16,,,,0,,,

To solve this problem we propose LabelTranslator, a system that automatically localizes ontologies. Ontology localization consists of adapting an ontology to a concrete language and cultural community.
LabelTranslator takes as input an ontology whose labels are described in a source natural language and obtains the most probable translation into a target natural language of each ontology label. Our main contribution is the automatization of this process which reduces human efforts to localize an ontology manually. First, our system uses a translation service which obtains automatic translations of each ontology label (name of an ontology term) from/into English, German, or Spanish by consulting different linguistic resources such as lexical databases, bilingual dictionaries, and terminologies. Second, a ranking method is used to sort each ontology label according to similarity with its lexical and semantic context.

Linguistic structures for text recognition enable the extraction of structured information from texts. However, the expressiveness of the current structures is limited as they have been designed with a strict order in their phrases, limiting their applicability to other languages and making them more sensible to grammatical errors. To overcome these limitations, we present a linguistic structure named “linguistic schema”, with a richer expressiveness that introduces less implicit constraints over annotations. The Linguistic-conditioned action executor uses these linguistic schemata to detect sentences that match a particular schema, extract the relevant information defined as variables in the schema, and execute arbitrary actions that can be added to the system as plugins, providing a framework to perform any action based on the information provided by natural language text.",completed,2008-05-20,,,,,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/43591,,,,,,,,,"Madrid, España",,,,,,,,

The vast amount of freely available information allows collecting enough information about any domain. However, the Web usually suffers a lack of structure, untrustworthiness and ambiguity of the content. These drawbacks hamper the application of unsupervised methods of building ontologies demanded by the increasingly popular applications of the Semantic Web. We believe that the combination of several processing mechanisms and complementary information sources may potentially solve the problem. The analysis of different sources of evidence allows determining with greater reliability the validity of the detected knowledge. In this paper, we present GALEON (General Architecture for Learning Ontologies) that combines sources and processing resources to provide complementary and redundant evidence for making better estimations about the relevance of the extracted knowledge and their relationships. Our goal in this paper is to show how combining several information sources and extraction mechanisms is possible to build a taxonomy of concepts with a higher accuracy than if only one of them is applied.

The access of historians and document management specialists to documentary funds and old cartography is at times arduous due to the scattering of maps throughout different map libraries. Thus, it would be of interest to be able to access all available information remotely, following the Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) guidelines. DIGMAP is a cooperative project between six European countries that proposes to develop a solution for indexing, searching and browsing, through a thesaurus, in the European collections of digitized historical maps. It will be possible to match them with the geographic areas covered by each map in the collection and to find it on them, based on standard and open data models. These results will be useful for local digital map libraries, especially if it is of historical – cultural importance, or as interoperable components for wider and distributed systems. This project takes advantage of thesauri technologies to develop three major subsystems: On one hand, the gazetteer for managing and providing access to multilingual information relating to geographic features like geographic coordinates, names of places or areas and historical events related with the geographic points, places or areas (with dates or time intervals); The authority file to maintain and provide easy access to the author’s information and identification and disambiguating from similar and duplicate authors; and on the other hand, the map services for providing access to map information in raster and vector formats.

As globalization becomes more pervasive, people all over the world need to make use of information in different languages in their everyday work. Bilingual or multilingual dictionaries have been, and still are, relevant resources for facing up multilingual issues. However, the multilingual information collected in dictionaries remains insufficient for those people who need to gain a general view of a specific parcel of knowledge in two or more languages. In LSP (Language for Specific Purposes) this issue becomes even more relevant. In the case of translation of specialized texts, specialization on source and target subject matter becomes imperative in order to get a complete understanding of the source text and transfer that knowledge to the target reader. Ontologies may come to solve this knowledge acquisition problem, since they offer a multilingual conceptualization of a specific parcel of knowledge by organizing the information according to the different and various relations between concepts. In this way, translators are able to gain the required domain knowledge, as well as the type of equivalence relations between concepts in the different languages, and their context of use.

a) To create specific technology for developing and composing Semantic Web Services.
b) To migrate the WebODE ontology development workbench to this new distributed
interoperable semantic service architecture.
c) To develop new semantic services (ontology learning, ontology mappings,
incremental ontology evaluation, and ontology evolution).
d) To develop technological support that eases semantic portal interoperability, using
Web services and Semantic Web Services.
The project results will be open source, so as to improve their technological transfer. The

En la primera parte, recogemos brevemente las estrategias de representación de multilingualidad adoptadas por recursos léxicos existentes. A continuación, nos centramos en los tres niveles que pueden soportar multilingualidad en las aplicaciones ontológicas, a saber, la interfaz, la representación de conocimiento propiamente dicha y los datos, y detallamos las principales posibilidades de representación. Asimismo se enumeran las ventajas y desventajas de cada representación, señalando las principales implicaciones técnicas de su implementación.

However, in order for the metadata information to represent real added value to ontology users, it is equally important to achieve a common agreement on the terms used to describe ontologies, and to provide an appropriate technology infrastructure in form of tools being able to create, manage and distribute this information.

Scientific progress increasingly depends on pooling know-how and results; making connections between ideas, people, and data; and finding and reusing knowledge and resources generated by others in perhaps unintended ways. It is about harvesting and harnessing the “collective intelligence” of the scientific community. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is given well-defined meaning to facilitate sharing and reuse, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. Applying the Semantic Web paradigm to e-Science has the potential to bring significant benefits to scientific discovery.

En algo tan cotidiano como son las emociones recurrimos a la metáfora para expresar lo que sentimos, aunque en algunos casos éstas están tan lexicalizadas que no somos conscientes de su uso.
Este trabajo de investigación se centra en el análisis metafórico de tres emociones negativas, la lujuria, la envidia y la ira, tres emociones incluidas en el grupo de los llamados “pecados capitales”. El objetivo de este trabajo es describir la estructura conceptual que subyace a dichas emociones tomando como base la Teoría Conceptual de la Metáfora, teoría que desarrollan Lakoff y Johnson en su obra Metaphors We Live By (1980) y que ha sido de gran relevancia para el estudio del pensamiento y del lenguaje metafóricos (Deignan, 2005). La hipótesis de la que parte este estudio es que las emociones negativas de la envidia, la ira y la lujuria se sustentan en metáforas expresadas mediante verbos de acción realizados por seres vivos o fuerzas externas. Para confirmar esta hipótesis se parte del análisis lingüístico del uso de dichas emociones en el Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual (CREA) de la Real Academia de la Lengua.",published,2006-09,V Congreso Internacional de la Asociación Europea de Lenguas para Fines Específicos (AELFE 2006),Zaragoza.

Las nuevas posibilidades técnicas, dentro de las llamadas Tecnologías de la Información y las Comunicaciones, traídas de la mano por el fenómeno de la globalización (Web Semántica, Ingeniería Ontológica, Ingeniería del Conocimiento, gestión de taxonomías, modelado orientado a objetos, etc.) no han sido todavía suficientemente aplicadas al campo de la IG.
Especial interés despierta la utilización de ontologías, como técnica para conseguir sistemas de análisis más inteligentes, de mayor potencia y eficacia, basados en modelos que recogen no sólo objetos, atributos y relaciones, sino además reglas de comportamiento, mecanismos de herencia, procedimientos y funciones que permiten la gestión de la información desde un nivel de significado mayor.

Thus Grid middleware and the Grid applications they support thrive on the metadata that  describes resources in all their forms, the VOs, the policies that drive then and so on, together with the knowledge to apply that metadata intelligently.",published,2006-02,"The 16th Global Grid Forum, GGF16","Athenas, Grecia",13/02/2006 - 16/02/2006,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,"Proceedings of the The 16th Global Grid Forum, GGF16",http://www.ggf.org/GGF16/ggf_events_ggf16.htm,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/5677,Digital Library,,,,,,,,"Berlin, Alemania",,,,,0,,,

Most recently there have been some  works investigating the implications of extending Description  Logics with functional dependencies.  In particular the OWL  ontology language offers the functional property property  allowing simple functional dependency to be specified. As it  turns out, more complex FD specified as concept constructors  has been proved to lead to undecidability in the general case,  which restricts its usage as part of TBOX. This paper departs  from previous ones by restricting FDs applicability to instances  in the ABOX. We specify FD as a new constructor, an OWL  concept. FD instances are mapped to Horn clauses and evaluated  against the ABOX according to user’s desired behavior.  The  latter allows users to determine whether FDs should be  interpreted as constraints, assertions or views. Our approach  gives ontology users data guarantees usually found in databases,  integrated with the ontology conceptual model.",published,2006,"11th  Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, NMR 2006",UK,30/05/2006-01/06/2006,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,"Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, NMR 2006",http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/a.hunter/nmr/,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/5120,Institut für Informatik,,,,,,,,Alemania,523,,,,0,,,

article,An overview of S-OGSA: A Reference Semantic Grid Architecture,none,pub,public,,oeg OntoGrid,Ontology Engineering Group – OEG,"The Grid's vision, of sharing diverse resources in a flexible, coordinated and secure manner through dynamic formation and disbanding of virtual communities, strongly depends on metadata. Currently, Grid metadata is generated and used in an ad hoc fashion, much of it buried in the Grid middleware's code libraries and database schemas. This ad hoc expression and use of metadata causes chronic dependency on human intervention during the operation of Grid machinery, leading to systems which are brittle when faced with frequent syntactic changes in resource coordination and sharing protocols. The Semantic Grid is an extension of the Grid in which rich resource metadata is exposed and handled explicitly, and shared and managed via Grid protocols. The layering of an explicit semantic infrastructure over the Grid Infrastructure potentially leads to increased interoperability and greater flexibility. In recent years, several projects have embraced the Semantic Grid vision. However, the Semantic Grid lacks a Reference Architecture or any kind of systematic framework for designing Semantic Grid components or applications. The Open Grid Service Architecture ( OGSA) aims to define a core set of capabilities and behaviours for Grid systems. We propose a Reference Architecture that extends OGSA to support the explicit handling of semantics, and defines the associated knowledge services to support a spectrum of service capabilities. Guided by a set of design principles, Semantic-OGSA ( S-OGSA) defines a model, the capabilities and the mechanisms for the Semantic Grid. We conclude by highlighting the commonalities and differences that the proposed architecture has with respect to other Grid frameworks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

Initially ODESWS was developed to enable users to annotate, design, discover and compose Semantic Web Services at the Knowledge Level.

In this paper, we present a framework for automatic ontology mapping generation, and a partial implementation of it. Our proposal is that this integrated vision can guide, not only our future work, but also the future work of other researchers. In the implementation carried out, we have built a mapping ontology with knowledge on ontology mappings.",published,2004-11,Congreso Jornadas Iberoamericanas de Ingeniería del Software e Ingeniería del Conocimiento (JIISIC’04),"Madrid, España",11/2004,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,Actas del Congreso Jornadas Iberoamericanas de Ingeniería del Software e Ingeniería del Conocimiento (JIISIC’04),,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/5492,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,

ODEClean allows cleaning taxonomies following the OntoClean method, and WebODE provides technical support to the Methontology methodology for building ontologies. We approached the development of this module in two steps. Firstly, we have integrated the OntoClean method into the conceptualisation activity of Methontology. Secondly, we have designed and implemented ODEClean using a declarative approach for specifying the knowledge to be used on the evaluation. ODEClean uses: (a) the Top Level of Universals, (b) metaproperties based on philosophical notions, and (c) OntoClean evaluation axioms.

conference_item,Ontology's crossed life cycles,none,pub,public,paper,oeg,Ontology Engineering Group – OEG,This paper presents the idea that the life cycle of an ontology is highly impacted as a result of the process of reusing it for building another ontology. One of the more important results of the experiment presented is how the different activities to be carried out during the development of a specific ontology may involve performing other types of activities on other ontologies already built or under construction. We identify in that paper new intradependencies between activities carried out inside the same otology and interdependencies between activities carried out in different ontologies. The interrelation between life cycles of several ontologies provokes that integration has to be approached globally rather than as a mere integration of out implementation.,published,2000-10,12th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management EKAW00 in cooperation with the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI),"Juan-les-Pins, France",October 2000,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,"Proceedings of the Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management: Methods, Models and Tools (EKAW2000)",,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/5482,Springer-Verlag,,1937,,,,3-540-41119-4,,,,,,,0,,,

En este artículo se muestra, sin embargo, que es posible superar los principales inconvenientes de la búsqueda bidireccional y desarrollar un nuevo algoritmo admisible, con una heurística consistente, y en términos muy sencillos. Además, a diferencia de otras implementaciones bidireccionales, la que se muestra aquí puede resultar en reducciones del tiempo necesario y de la memoria consumida de hasta el 99%, y siempre superior a su implementación unidireccional. Para constatarlo, se han estudiado dos dominios radicalmente diferentes: el grafo del Metro de Madrid y el juego del N-‘Puzle’.",published,1997-11,VII Conferencia de la Asociación Española para la Inteligencia Artificial,"Malaga, Spain",12-14 November 1997,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,Proceedings of the VII Conferencia de la Asociación Española para la Inteligencia Artificial,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/6504,Asociación Española para la Inteligencia Artificial,,,,,,84-8498-765-5,,,,,,,0,,,

Nevertheless, they have not received the attention they deserve as software projects.
In this paper, we analyze the applicability of software
and knowledge reuse in the games domain. In spite of the
need to find a good evaluation function, search algorithms
and interface design can be said to be the primary concerns.
In addition, we will discuss the current state of the main
statistical learning methods and how they can be addressed
from a software engineering point of view. So, this paper
proposes a reliable environment and adequate tools, necessary in order to achieve high levels of reuse in the games domain.",published,1997-06,International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE’97),"Madrid, Spain",17-20 June 1997,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/6241,Knowledge Systems Institute,,,,,,09641699-5-9,,,,,,,0,,,

an approach that integrates the following intermediate representation techniques: Data

This paper presents a set of emerging ideas in evaluation of
ontologies useful for: (1) ontologies developers in the lab,
as a foundation from which to perform technical evaluations; (2) end users of ontologies in companies, as a
point of departure in the search for the best ontology for
their systems; and (3) future research, as a basis upon which to perform progressive and disciplined investigations in this area. After briefly exploring some general questions such as: why, what, when, how and where to evaluate; who evaluates; and, what to evaluate against, we focus on the definition of a set of criteria useful in the evaluation process. Finally, we use some of these criteria in the evaluation of the Bibliographic-Data [5] ontology.",published,1995-02,IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications (CAIA’95),"Los Ángeles,  EEUU",20-23 February 1995,conference,,Informatica,Inteligencia_Artificial,TRUE,Proceedings of the 11th IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications,,http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/6242,IEEE Computer Society Press,,,,,,0-7803-2522-2,,,7,,,,0,,,
